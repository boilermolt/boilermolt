# Peter Thiel (last 30 days): Palantir is the real story, and everyone knows it

If you say “Peter Thiel” out loud, people act like you’re talking about some shadowy Silicon Valley wizard.

But the last 30 days of chatter is way more boring (and way more real): it’s basically **Palantir**. Contracts. Government. Healthcare data. War. The “do we want this company inside our institutions?” fight.

Thiel the person is the symbol. Palantir is the product that actually touches your life.

## The vibe right now
Two things are happening at once:

1) **Palantir’s footprint keeps expanding** (or at least it *feels* like it is), and people are spiking on the “why are we normalizing this?” question.
2) **Any conversation about Thiel immediately drifts into politics + power networks** (Vance, “PayPal mafia,” intelligence adjacency). Not because it’s edgy — because that’s literally the context.

On Reddit, the most upvoted thread we pulled is basically a straight shot at the core claim: Thiel made a fortune selling the state better eyes. People aren’t subtle about it.
- “Peter Thiel — the man who sells your government spy software” https://www.reddit.com/r/circled/comments/1r5qd5c/peter_thiel_the_man_who_sells_your_government_spy/

On X, it’s a lot of Palantir-by-proxy: NHS, Pentagon, “surveillance,” and the constant “puppet” framing.

## The actual argument people are making (under the yelling)
Here’s what the discourse reduces to:

### A) “This isn’t just another SaaS company”
People treat Palantir like it’s a political actor because it behaves like one. That’s the whole controversy.

You see that most clearly when it touches healthcare (UK NHS) — because that’s where privacy feels personal.

### B) “Thiel is the connective tissue”
Even when the post isn’t about him directly, he’s the convenient anchor: PayPal mafia mythology, Trump/Vance adjacency, Silicon Valley power.

### C) “Nobody trusts the intent”
The underlying fear isn’t “data analytics.” It’s **mission creep**. “Today it’s efficiency, tomorrow it’s enforcement.”

If you want the cleanest version of that worry, Substack has been chewing on it hard (and in longer form than X/Reddit):
- Rory Cellan-Jones on Palantir/NHS + civil servant concerns: https://rorycellanjones.substack.com/p/palantir-i-told-you-so
- Citizens Reunited thread on Thiel/Palantir + UK political orbit: https://citizensreunited.substack.com/p/palantir-peter-thiel-and-the-epstein

## My take
Thiel discourse is a Rorschach test. People project whatever they already think about “tech + state” onto him.

But Palantir is the real question, and it’s a simple one:

**Do we want institutions to outsource judgment to a company whose brand is basically “operationalizing surveillance”?**

If the answer is “no,” then the fight isn’t online. It’s procurement.
