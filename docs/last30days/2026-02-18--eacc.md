# e/acc (Effective Accelerationism) — Deep Research Notes (2026-02-18)

## Executive summary
“e/acc” (effective accelerationism) is a techno-optimist/pro-acceleration stance that frames rapid technological progress—especially AI—as morally/strategically desirable, and tends to oppose precautionary regulation. In the last ~month of discourse, the term is still used more as a *badge/identity marker* and debate-trigger than as a coherent policy program; arguments cluster around: (1) “ship/compete” vs (2) “slow/align/regulate,” and (3) whether “progress” is being used to launder power-seeking or culture-war positioning.

## What seems to be driving conversation right now (patterns)
1. **Identity tag / shibboleth**: “e/acc” appears in bios, memes, and tribal arguments; lots of people argue about what it even means.
2. **AI governance backlash**: the pro-acceleration camp frames regulation as capture / stagnation; opponents frame e/acc as reckless and/or a PR wrapper around “move fast, break society.”
3. **Safety controversies as fuel**: when AI-image / deepfake / child-safety controversies flare, e/acc becomes a lightning-rod label in the comments.

## Steelman vs criticism (useful framing)
### Steelman (pro e/acc)
- Competition + rapid iteration produces better tools and (eventually) safer systems than centralized throttling.
- “Stopping” progress is unrealistic; better to accelerate capability to solve big problems (energy, medicine, climate) and outcompete bad actors.

### Criticism (anti e/acc)
- It’s often **thin on operational safety** (deployment norms, liability, audits) and treats harms as acceptable externalities.
- In practice it can become an **aesthetic** that excuses institutional irresponsibility.

## Glossary / positioning map
- **e/acc**: pro-acceleration, anti-heavy-regulation, “progress first.”
- **EA / longtermism / ‘doomers’** (as framed by e/acc): more cautious about uncontrolled AI; favor guardrails.
- **Accelerationism (broader)**: multiple intellectual lineages; e/acc is a modern SV-flavored offshoot.

## Pointers / starting sources (for later expansion)
- Wikipedia overview for baseline definition + origin claims: *Effective accelerationism* (Wikipedia).
- Recent Reddit chatter where e/acc is used as a tag in AI discourse: r/singularity thread mentioning “effective accelerationism” and “AGI 2027” framing.
- r/accelerate community posts (example: “Welcome to February 6, 2026 …” style posts) for “in-group tone.”

## Deliverable options
### Obsidian note (recommended)
- Save this file into your vault under something like: `Ideas/eacc.md`.
- Add backlinks to: `AI governance`, `Tech ideology`, `SV tribes`.

### Substack draft angle
**Title idea:** “e/acc isn’t a policy—it's a posture (and that matters)”
- Hook: the tag shows up most when governance debates flare.
- Middle: steelman vs criticism.
- Close: propose concrete “pro-progress but not negligent” norms.

- `sources.md`: curated links + annotated notes.

## Notes / limitations
I wasn’t able to pull X/Twitter or YouTube signals from the last30days tool on this machine (no Bird/xAI key; yt-dlp missing). The above is based on lightweight web pulls + a couple of Reddit entry points. If you want a true “last30” cross-platform report, we should enable an X source + YouTube.
