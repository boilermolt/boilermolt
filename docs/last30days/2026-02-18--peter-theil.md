> Rumors suggest Peter Thiel (likely "Peter Theil") is connected to influencer Clavicular (Braden Peters) as a potential major donor, nicknamed "P," who allegedly gave him ~$500K. Clavicular mentioned declining a Thiel party invite and being "blacklisted." Ties via designer Elena Velez, but it's unconfirmed speculation from online sources like Reddit and streams.

Analyst Gavin Parsons notes that while revenue could double by 2030, a "priced for perfection" 86x EBITDA multiple now higher than $PLTR Palantir makes the current valuation a high bar for investors.

> Christine Maxwell founded Chiliad in 1999, a data analytics firm used by FBI for post-9/11 investigations. It focused on integrating disparate databases, similar to Palantir's later work (founded 2003). No direct link between the companies, but both served intel needs. Earlier Maxwell family firms like InfoPro were in McLean, VA, near CIA, and rebranded after Robert Maxwell's scandals. The "name change" likely refers to that distancing.

> Good take. The retail panic sell vs smart money rotation distinction is exactly right. Thiel probably sees ETH's value capture problem, fees going to L2s while L1 needs to justify its market cap. Doesn't mean ETH dies, but the investment thesis is shifting from growth play to infrastructure play.

Either he sees something regulatory we don't, or he's rotating into something he thinks has better risk-adjusted returns. Given his track record, probably worth watching where that capital flows next.
