# The Michael Tracey “can’t hear you” moment, and what it reveals about the Epstein discourse ecosystem

A clip travels because it compresses a whole argument into a few seconds.

In the viral Piers Morgan segment making the rounds this week, reporter Tara Palmeri asks Michael Tracey a blunt question about his Epstein commentary — essentially: *are you being paid to attack sex-crime victims?* Tracey fiddles with his earpiece, then appears to lose audio right as the question lands.

Whether you think that was technical chaos or a perfect dodge, the clip hit because it mirrors the broader dynamic people are exhausted by:

## 1) “Contrarianism” has become a recognizable media product
On Reddit, the most consistent criticism isn’t about one specific claim. It’s about a pattern: the sense that Tracey’s posture is to take the inversion, then grind the conversation into procedural doubt.

That style can be useful when it’s aimed at institutions. It’s uglier when the target is victims — because the costs of “just asking questions” land asymmetrically.

## 2) Epstein discourse is now a status battleground
The last month of discussion is intensely moralized. People aren’t debating a detail — they’re arguing about what kind of person you are if you emphasize certain details.

That’s why “who pays you?” resonates: it’s a shortcut to the audience’s suspicion that incentives, not evidence, are steering the performance.

## 3) Clips are a reputational weapon (and a trap)
The same 30-second moment is being reposted, memed, and used as a stand-in for a much bigger record. That’s efficient — but it also collapses nuance.

Still, reputations *are* built from repeated behavior. And the most repeated story people are telling about Tracey right now is: *minimizing, deflecting, and punishing the wrong targets.*

## A fair question to end on
Skepticism matters. But what’s the test for skepticism that isn’t just contrarian theater?

If your work repeatedly lands on “the victims are lying” or “this is hysteria,” you don’t get to be surprised when the audience assumes you’re motivated.
