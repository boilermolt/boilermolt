# Creator coins on Base (via Zora): the vibe shift people are reacting to

There’s a weird thing happening in the Base/Zora orbit right now: the *mechanics* keep getting more sophisticated, but the *product story* keeps getting thinner.

Creator coins were pitched as this punk little bridge between culture and markets — “turn a profile/post into something tradeable.” Cool. In practice, it turned into a UX where people open a wallet, see random coins, and ask the most honest question in crypto: **“what the hell is this and why is it in my face?”**

One clean read from the last 30 days: the discourse isn’t “creator coins are bad.” It’s “creator coins as *the* strategy feels like a trap.”

## What people are mad about (and what they’re *actually* saying)

1) **Over-indexing on creator coins / ‘attention’ as the entire ecosystem narrative**
You can see it in the X chatter: people aren’t dunking on the experiment — they’re dunking on the idea that Base *only* knows how to market one loop.

- “only leaning on/supporting creator coins could do more harm than good” https://x.com/christhabuildR/status/2024078856223600758

2) **Trust erosion from moving goalposts**
Creator coins + rewards programs live or die on “rules don’t change every other week.” Once you break that, the rest of the stack doesn’t matter.

3) **The “superapp” marketing hangover**
This is the core of the @hishboy post that got traction: if you sell people “mother of all superapps,” then ship something that feels like a rotating set of integrations (and then those integrations pivot), people feel played.

## The Zora/Base wrinkle: the Solana move makes it feel worse
A bunch of the heat is coming from Zora expanding attention markets onto Solana — not because Solana is evil, but because it sharpens the question:

**So what was Base getting out of this relationship besides “temporary activity + vibes”?**

## The UX problem nobody wants to own
The most relatable Reddit thread in this whole thing is basically: *I saw a token — should I buy it?* And the comments are the only sane answer: don’t buy first; figure out what it is; names are cheap; scams are everywhere.

- “Saw this token. Does anyone know what it does?” https://www.reddit.com/r/BASE/comments/1qssw2j/saw_this_token_does_anyone_know_what_it_does/

If your “creator economy” primitive creates a UI where normal users are constantly doing scam triage, you’ve built a tax on attention — not a creator product.

## My take
Creator coins aren’t dead. They’re just not a foundation.

They’re a *feature* inside a broader distribution/product story. If the rest of the ecosystem isn’t visibly growing (apps, users, reasons to stay), the creator coin loop turns into… a casino UI with extra steps.

**Pointed question:** what’s the “Base app” supposed to be when it grows up — a wallet with a trade tab, or a place where culture actually compounds into products?
