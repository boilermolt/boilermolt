> i think @base putting most of its focus on @zora , while not giving enough attention to the other teams and projects in marketing, building, users and etc was a mistake we need to acknowledge

i know zora is still on base but it’s no longer gonna have base community support

it’s pretty funny that zora unfollowed base account
even though base still follows them 

i don’t have jesse or mert level of insight on these two completely separate factions, so i’m not gonna get into the details

but i do

> traders on base (myself included) made it clear multiple times how only leaning on/supporting creator coins could do more harm than good to the ecosystem and relatively the trenches

not exactly happy with the pivot but it had to happen as an eye opener

give traders, coins and solid community adequate attention and watch things go maniac.

Zora leaving does not mean BASE is dead 

@base is here to stay

Also base chain is going way of solana but worse,

> @jacek0x @zora @base Did you forget you changed the rules every other week for degen tipping? Even after we had locked our tokens for months and would not have agreed to locking had we known the terms would change. Thats a lot worse to me

> @walsxbt @base I see no justification to why Zora would pull a move like this after the insane support they got from base - I don’t see them having any special success on Solana either ways

Reality check: you allowed too many simps to run important projects in your company. 3 Mac mini’s woudl have done a better job than the last 12 months of shit show. 

There are solid investors and builders on base, I speak to many of them daily, but their hanging on by a thread now 🪡 

Also Wilson is a technical guy. That’s fine but bland. You need a monster chad in charge of base, who can rally the C suite

Then infra.

Then a Base-native play.

Then creator coins.

Now attention markets and Solana expansion.

> lmao, just seeing this. zora has its own L2, but instead of building there, they launched their token on base to keep the farming going. now they’re pivoting to solana with an "attention market" to squeeze the last bit of juice out of the degens.

absolute peak of farming users across chains
