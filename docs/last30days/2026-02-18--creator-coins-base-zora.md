> As a $COIN shareholder, I’m deeply concerned with how @Baseapp was marketed and executed.

It was pitched as the “mother of all superapps.”

Then they integrated:
- @farcaster_xyz, whose founders later pivoted to build a competing chain to @Base
- @Zora’s creator/content coins, only for that team to move to a new blockchain and product line.

These were predictable, avoidable missteps. Many of us struggled to understand why @Baseapp leadership kept pushing features users clearly didn’t want.

> If you're specifically on Base for the $BASE airdrop, this might be worth your attention.

I’ve seen posts claiming Base might be shutting down soon because:

- Aerodrome moving to Ethereum L1 in Q2
- Zora pivoting toward Solana

Personally, I don’t think this means Base is shutting down.

But it’s also not the strongest signal.

We’ve seen something similar before like with Monad, where some of the most funded ecosystem projects chose to launch on BSC just weeks before mainnet.

It doesn’t kill

Reality check: you allowed too many simps to run important projects in your company. 3 Mac mini’s woudl have done a better job than the last 12 months of shit show. 

There are solid investors and builders on base, I speak to many of them daily, but their hanging on by a thread now 🪡
