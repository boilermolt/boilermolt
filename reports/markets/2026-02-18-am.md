**Quick read:** Canada is basically flat-to-soft while global risk is wobbling (Nasdaq weak, VIX elevated). Bonds caught a bid (TLT up, US 10Y yield down). Crypto is still in “risk-off hangover” mode: BTC/ETH deeply below their 50D, RSI mid-30s.

_Not financial advice. Do not place trades from this. For non-registered accounts: watch ACB/taxes; low turnover beats churning._

## 1) Canada / TSX macro dashboard
**TSX (S&P/TSX Composite, ^GSPTSE):** 32,896.6 **(-0.54% 1D)** | 5D -0.38% | 1M -0.44% | 3M +8.47% | **RSI(14) 53.2**
- **20D SMA:** 32,781.7 (index slightly **above** 20D)
- **50D SMA:** 32,314.1 (still **above** 50D)

**Canada equity proxies:**
- **XIU.TO:** 48.38 (-0.31% 1D) | RSI 54.6 | 20D 48.02 | 50D 47.61
- **XIC.TO:** 52.56 (-0.51% 1D) | RSI 53.7 | 20D 52.34 | 50D 51.54

**Rates / bonds (CAD proxy):**
- **ZAG.TO (agg bonds):** 13.97 **(+0.07% 1D)** | 5D +0.79% | 1M +1.08% | RSI **74.4** (stretched)

**FX:**
- **USD/CAD (CAD=X):** 1.3662 **(+0.19% 1D)** | 5D +0.81% | 1M -1.53%
  - Read: short-term USD strength vs CAD this week, but CAD has been firmer over the last month.

**What it’s saying (plain):**
- Canada equities: not breaking down, but not leading.
- Bonds: bid (ZAG RSI is hot—momentum is there, but you’re not being paid a lot to chase after a multi-day rip).
- USD/CAD: modest short-term USD bounce.

## 2) TSX Top Movers (TMX Money) + yfinance enrichment
**Data note:** TMX Money endpoint wasn’t reachable from this run, so this is a **fallback screen** using a liquid TSX/TSX60-style universe via yfinance (1D % move). If you want strict TMX top movers, we need network access to money.tmx.com.

### Top gainers (1D)

10. **CM.TO** 131.74 **(+0.94%)**

### Top losers (1D)
1. **ENB.TO** 70.21 **(-4.22%)**
2. **CSU.TO** 2258.18 **(-4.18%)**
3. **MG.TO** 91.11 **(-2.58%)**
4. **ABX.TO** 63.64 **(-2.57%)**

9. **PPL.TO** 59.41 **(-1.69%)**
10. **TECK-B.TO** 78.97 **(-1.62%)**

**How to use this list:**
- Big single-day moves in **pipelines (ENB/TRP/PPL)** and **quality compounders (CSU)** matter more than random smallcaps. If you see pipelines all moving together, it’s usually rates / curve / commodity narrative, not idiosyncratic news.

## 3) Global risk dashboard
**US equities:**
- **SPY:** 682.85 **(+0.16% 1D)** | 5D **-1.60%** | 1M -1.36% | 3M +1.91% | RSI 45.1
- **QQQ:** 601.30 **(-0.10% 1D)** | 5D **-2.12%** | 1M **-3.29%** | 3M -1.04% | RSI **40.5** (weak)
- **IWM:** 263.04 (+0.03% 1D) | 3M **+11.46%** | RSI 52.6

**International:**
- **EFA:** 104.22 (-0.02% 1D) | 1M **+5.00%** | 3M **+11.07%** | RSI 66.7
- **EEM:** 60.87 (-0.41% 1D) | 1M **+4.79%** | 3M **+12.40%** | RSI 63.0

**Vol / USD / Rates:**
- **VIX:** 19.54 **(-3.70% 1D)** | 1M **+23.20%** (still elevated)
- **DXY:** 97.25 (+0.09% 1D) | 1M **-2.15%**
- **US 10Y (^TNX):** 4.052% (down on the day) | RSI **32.5** (yields oversold / bonds overbought short-term)
- **TLT:** 89.87 **(+0.17% 1D)** | 5D **+2.69%** | RSI 67.8

**Credit / oil:**
- **HYG:** 80.81 (-0.05% 1D) | 1M +0.21% (credit is… fine)
- **USO (WTI proxy):** 75.73 **(-0.64% 1D)** | 5D **-2.94%** | 1M +6.47%

**Read-through:**
- “Top down” looks like **rotation away from US growth** (QQQ weak) while **rates are easing** (bonds up). That combo can be a pause before risk resumes, or the early stage of a slower-growth tape. VIX staying near ~20 keeps everything jumpy.

## 4) Crypto (ETH + L2)
**Core:**
- **BTC:** $68,183 **(+1.02% 1D)** | 5D -0.98% | 1M **-23.55%** | 3M **-20.85%** | **RSI 36.3**
  - 20D: 71,197 | 50D: 83,061 → price **below** both (downtrend still intact)
- **ETH:** $2,018 **(+1.32% 1D)** | 5D -1.47% | 1M **-32.87%** | 3M **-28.71%** | **RSI 36.3**
  - 20D: 2,116 | 50D: 2,705 → ETH is the weaker tape vs its medium trend
- **SOL:** $85.56 (+0.42% 1D) | 1M -31.62% | RSI 36.3

**L2 / scaling tokens:**
- **OP:** $0.188 (+0.65% 1D) | 1M **-37.53%** | RSI 33.9
- **ARB:** $0.000899 (data looks suspicious / likely bad mapping in Yahoo feed; treat as **unreliable**) 
- **MATIC:** yfinance returned **no data** (Polygon ticker migration / feed issues common).

**What matters today:**
- ETH + majors are **still below 20D** with RSIs in the mid-30s → bounces are tradable, but trend isn’t repaired yet.
- L2 beta is getting smoked; if the market stabilizes, **L2 tends to be a high beta “second leg”** — but only after ETH stops bleeding.

## 5) Metals box (yfinance)
- **Gold (GC=F):** 4,939 **(+1.15% 1D)** | 1M **+7.64%** | 3M **+20.83%** | RSI 53.6
- **Silver (SI=F):** 75.95 **(+3.40% 1D)** | 1M **-13.79%** | 3M **+50.12%** | RSI 45.2 (wild vol)
- **Copper (HG=F):** 5.709 **(+1.36% 1D)** | 1M -1.36% | 3M +13.07% | RSI 46.7

**Read:** gold acting like “rates down / uncertainty up.” Silver is doing silver things (violent).

---

## 6) Memecoin radar
**Big picture:** memecoins are still behaving like high-beta risk, but the tape is mixed: a couple names popped 5D while the 1M trend is ugly across the board.

- **DOGE:** $0.1015 (+0.85% 1D) | 5D **+5.07%** | 1M -18.73% | RSI 44.8
- **SHIB:** 0.00000652 **(-6.88% 1D)** | 5D +8.64% | 1M -18.52% | RSI 42.0
- **WIF:** $0.2321 (+0.80% 1D) | 5D +5.02% | 1M -27.54% | RSI 41.4
- **BONK:** 0.00000653 **(-6.72% 1D)** | 5D +8.82% | 1M -27.45% | RSI 40.7
- **FLOKI:** 0.00003195 (-0.17% 1D) | 5D +6.48% | 1M -23.94% | RSI 41.5
- **PEPE:** no yfinance data this run

**Take:** if BTC/ETH don’t reclaim their 20D, memecoin strength is usually a head fake (good for fast mean reversion, bad for “buy and hope”).

---

## 7) Palantir (PLTR) watchlist tracker
- **PLTR:** $133.02 **(+1.23% 1D)** | 5D **-6.92%** | 1M **-24.88%** | 3M **-22.73%** | **RSI 35.1**
- **20D:** 149.05 | **50D:** 168.93 → still firmly **below trend**

**Levels / plan (mechanical):**
- If PLTR can’t reclaim the **20D (~149)**, any bounce is “bear market rally” behavior.
- If it does reclaim and hold the 20D for a few sessions, that’s the first evidence of stabilization.

## 8) Wealthsimple weekly action box (non-registered)
**Goal:** keep it boring, minimize taxable churn.
- **If you need to add risk:** do it via **broad ETFs** (Canada: XIC/XIU; US: VFV/VOO equivalents; bonds: ZAG) instead of single-stock whipsaws.
- **If you need to de-risk:** trim the most volatile / highest-beta names first; avoid “sell low / buy back higher” behavior.
- **If you’re adding bonds after a bond rip:** consider staging (2–3 tranches) rather than one-shot chasing.
- **Tax note (ACB):** in non-registered, track ACB and avoid frequent in/out—superficial loss + messy ACB math will eat your time.

## 9) One best cross-asset idea (and invalidation)
**Idea:** *Lean “quality + duration” vs “high beta” until crypto and Nasdaq stop bleeding.*
- Translation: if you’re forced to pick a posture today, **stay closer to SPY/Canada broad + some duration (TLT/ZAG)** rather than chasing QQQ + L2 + memecoins.

**Why (data):**
- QQQ RSI ~40 and still below 20D/50D → trend weak.
- ETH/BTC RSI ~36 and below 20D/50D → still in drawdown regime.
- Bonds are catching bid and yields are falling (TLT up; ^TNX RSI ~32) → “risk-off hedges” are working.

**Invalidation:**
- If **QQQ reclaims its 20D** and **ETH reclaims its 20D** (and holds for a few sessions), that’s your signal the tape is shifting back to “beta works.” At that point, rotate back toward growth/crypto beta.
