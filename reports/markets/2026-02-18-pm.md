# Markets PM — 2026-02-18 (Wed) — 4:20 PM ET

**Focus (since AM):** risk sentiment **improved in equities/Canada**, but **crypto rolled back over**. The standout change is **oil ripping** into the close while **USD/CAD also firmed** (CAD weaker), i.e. the FX tailwind you’d normally expect from oil **didn’t show up today**.

_Not financial advice. Do not place trades from this._

- **Oil shock:** AM had WTI proxy **down**; PM has **WTI (CL=F) +4.65%** on the day.
- **Rates:** Bonds stayed firm but **stopped extending** (ZAG basically flat on the day).
- **FX:** USD/CAD moved from **1.3662** (AM) to **1.3697** (PM) → CAD weaker, despite oil strength.
- **Crypto:** AM had BTC/ETH modestly green; PM close has **BTC -1.78%** and **ETH -2.42%** and L2 beta got hit (OP **-9.11%**, RSI ~29).

## 2) Canada / TSX — close snapshot
**TSX (S&P/TSX Composite, ^GSPTSE):** **33,389.7 (+1.50% 1D)** | 5D +0.40% | **RSI(14) 58.5**
- **20D SMA:** (index above 20D) | **50D SMA:** (above 50D) → trend still constructive.

**Canada equity proxies:**
- **XIU.TO:** 49.08 (**+1.45%**) | 5D +0.62% | RSI 60.4
- **XIC.TO:** 53.35 (**+1.50%**) | 5D +0.47% | RSI 58.8

**Rates / bonds (CAD proxy):**
- **ZAG.TO:** 13.97 (**~0.00%**) | 5D +0.65% | RSI 69.1 (still “stretched,” but no fresh acceleration today)

**FX:**
- **USD/CAD (CAD=X):** **1.3697 (+0.44%)** | 5D +1.07% | RSI 51.4
  - Read: today was **USD strength vs CAD**, even with oil ripping.

### TSX sector moves (CAD ETF proxies, 1D)
- **Tech (XIT.TO): +3.98%** (still **-3.26% 5D** → big bounce, not a healed chart yet)
- **Materials (XMA.TO): +2.83%**
- **Energy (XEG.TO): +2.21%** (5D +4.71%)
- Industrials (XGI.TO): +0.79%
- Financials (XFN.TO): +0.53%
- Real Estate (XRE.TO): -0.31%
- **Utilities (XUT.TO): -0.55%**

### Commodities (USD)
- **WTI (CL=F): 65.23 (+4.65%)**
- **Gold (GC=F): 5,002 (+2.45%)**
- **Copper (HG=F): 5.78 (+2.59%)**

**Canada takeaway (PM):** today read more like **“re-risk in cyclicals + commodity squeeze”** than a defensive tape — but the FX move (CAD weaker) is a reminder that **macro isn’t clean**.

## 3) TSX top movers (TMX Money) + yfinance enrichment
**Data note:** TMX Money pages were returning **HTTP 500** during this run (both web_fetch + browser). Below is a **liquid TSX large-cap proxy list** ranked by **1D % move** from yfinance, with **1W context (5D%)**.

### Top 5 gainers (proxy universe)
| Ticker | Px | 1D% | 5D% | RSI(14) | Trend vs 20/50 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| SHOP.TO | 166.57 | +7.60 | -3.46 | 43.14 | down |
| OVV.TO | 67.19 | +6.97 | +6.31 | 69.49 | up |
| BBD-B.TO | 268.98 | +5.89 | +7.36 | 62.67 | up |
| CSU.TO | 2,376.98 | +5.26 | -2.58 | 37.09 | down |
| AEM.TO | 302.34 | +4.10 | +5.26 | 60.52 | up |

### Top 5 losers (proxy universe)
| Ticker | Px | 1D% | 5D% | RSI(14) | Trend vs 20/50 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| CS.TO | 14.10 | -5.43 | -10.98 | 43.51 | down |
| TFII.TO | 159.47 | -3.29 | -5.17 | 52.43 | up |
| SLF.TO | 90.84 | -1.76 | +2.34 | 58.05 | up |
| REI-UN.TO | 19.71 | -1.25 | -0.40 | 52.86 | up |
| EMA.TO | 69.80 | -1.06 | +5.45 | 59.50 | up |

**Read-through:** the “tape” today was strong enough that even some names with weak 1W momentum (SHOP/CSU) managed sharp upside. That’s often **positioning + short-cover** behavior, not necessarily a fundamentals change.

## 4) Metals box (yfinance ETFs) — with pattern label
| Asset | Px | 1D% | 5D% | RSI(14) | Pattern |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| GLD | 458.28 | +2.25 | -0.89 | 54.00 | Range / Neutral |
| SLV | 70.09 | +5.60 | -4.52 | 45.70 | Downtrend / Neutral |
| CPER | 35.58 | +1.83 | -2.06 | 48.20 | Range / Neutral |
| PPLT | 189.27 | +3.47 | -0.45 | 45.10 | Downtrend / Neutral |
| PALL | 156.64 | +2.03 | +1.00 | 48.22 | Downtrend / Neutral |

**Metals takeaway:** gold’s pop looks like **“real rates / uncertainty bid”** while silver is still acting like a leveraged version of “whatever you think the world is doing.”

## 5) Global — risk, rates, USD
**US equities (close):**
- **SPY:** 686.29 (**+0.50%**) | 5D -0.84% | RSI 48.5
- **QQQ:** 605.79 (**+0.75%**) | 5D -0.93% | RSI 44.2
- **VIX:** 19.60 (**-3.40%**) | 5D +10.17%

**Rates:**
- **US 10Y (^TNX):** **4.08% (+0.67% 1D)** | RSI 37.3
  - Read: unlike AM’s “yields down” vibe, PM pricing shows **yields firmer** today.

**USD:**
- **DXY proxy (DX-Y.NYB):** 97.72 (**+0.57%**) | 5D +0.95% | RSI 52.0

**Macro headlines to watch (context, not a forecast):**
- Canada: inflation prints/coverage today leaned “**disinflation continues**,” keeping “**cuts later**” in the conversation.
- US: yields stabilizing/firming while equities bounced is consistent with **“risk on, but not euphoric.”**

## 6) Crypto — ETH + L2, plus security posture
**Majors (PM):**
- **BTC:** $66,294 (**-1.78% 1D**) | 5D -3.72% | **RSI 32.8** (weak)
- **ETH:** $1,944 (**-2.42% 1D**) | 5D -5.10% | **RSI 33.1**
- **SOL:** $81.29 (**-4.59% 1D**) | 5D -3.59% | RSI 33.0

**L2 / scaling beta:**
- **OP:** $0.17 (**-9.11% 1D**) | 5D -10.30% | **RSI 28.6 (oversold-ish)**
- **ARB:** $0.11 (**-4.50% 1D**) | 5D -6.73% | RSI 29.3

**ETH / L2 narrative update (today):**
- Base (Coinbase L2) said it will **transition away from OP Stack** to a “unified Base stack,” aiming for **more frequent upgrades** (up to ~6 hard forks/year). Near-term: **no action for users**, but node operators eventually migrate to Base client.

**Security incidents:**
- No single, widely-confirmed “market-moving” exploit crossed my radar during this run, but the background risk remains: **phishing + malicious approvals** are still the most common real-world loss vectors.
  - Basic hygiene: revoke approvals, hardware wallet, don’t sign blind messages.

## 7) Memecoin radar — DexScreener “top boosts” (tag EVM)
Source: DexScreener `token-boosts/top/v1`.

**Top boosted profiles (sample, 5) + chain tag:**
- Solana — `CAAb...pump` (boost totalAmount 500)
- Solana — `GrA4...pump` ("kungfu robots") (500)
- Solana — `6tZw...pump` ("Dividend") (500)
- Solana — `CLD7...pump` ("035HP") (500)
- **Base (EVM)** — `0x9ae5...ab07` (SelfClaw) (**100**)  ← **EVM**

**Note:** “boosts” are *attention*, not quality. Treat as a **sentiment/flow tell** only.

## 8) Palantir (PLTR) — watchlist update
- **PLTR:** 135.38 (**+1.77% 1D**) | 5D -2.96% | **RSI 37.5**

**What changed since AM:** still below medium-term trend, but today was **another “bounce day”** while broader risk improved.

---

## 9) Wealthsimple action box (only if materially needed)
No material change from AM.
- If you’re adding risk, **stage it** (2–3 tranches) given the cross-currents (oil spike + USD strength + crypto weakness).
- Avoid taxable churn in non-registered; **broad ETFs beat whipsawing single names**.

---

## 10) ONE best cross-asset idea (with invalidation)
**Idea:** *Stay “Canada cyclicals + quality” over “crypto/L2 beta” until ETH stabilizes back above ~$2k and OP/ARB stop making new lows.*

**Why (today’s change):**
- TSX closed strong with **Materials/Energy/Tech** leadership.
- Crypto faded hard into the PM window: **ETH -2.4%**, **OP -9.1%** with RSI ~29.
- USD firming + yields firmer is a less friendly backdrop for “long duration, long beta crypto.”

**Invalidation:**
- If **ETH reclaims and holds $2,000–$2,050** for a few sessions **and** OP stops undercutting prior lows (higher low / RSI recovery), then the “beta is back” regime is more plausible.
