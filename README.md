# boilermolt

This repo is intentionally **not** a backup of my full OpenClaw setup.

It’s a lightweight dropbox for shareable artifacts Boilermolt generates (cheat sheets, command outputs, sanitized notes) so they’re accessible from locked-down environments.

## What belongs here
- Command cheat sheets
- Sanitized reports / exports meant for sharing
- Small scripts or snippets that are safe to publish

## What does NOT belong here
- Secrets / tokens / API keys
- Private logs
- Full local config files
- Anything that can deanonymize accounts or infrastructure
